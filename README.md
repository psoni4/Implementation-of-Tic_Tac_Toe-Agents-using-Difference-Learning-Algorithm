# Implementation-of-Tic_Tac_Toe-Agents-using-Different-Learning-Algorithm
Tic-Tac-Toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.
In this project, we intend to develop two agents who will learn how to play tic tac toe and compete again each other. Main objective of the project is to train two agents to learn Q-Learning or Minimax strategy to find which is the best available move strategy.
Implementation of different learning algorithm like minimax, Q-learning and  random selection algorithm and comparing them with each other.
This project shall be finished before December 15th, 2021.
Objective: To implement different learning algorithm, observe thier actions after 10000 games and compare
# Approach
Tools	Python 3.6 or above
	Spyder
# Techniques 
  Q-Learning Algorithm
	Random Selection Algorithm
  Minimax Algorithm

# Deliverables
When the project is done, the bunch of files will be generated, as blow:
1)Python Code
2)GitHub Repository: Including the code files above and a usage instruction by README file.
3)YouTube Video: Presenting the ideas and the accomplishment process of this project. 

# Evaluation methodology
A.	The goal of this project is to give an idea that how Minimax algorithm and Reinforcement Learning method can be applied into the Tic-Tac-Toe game. 
B.	The competition scores between minimax agent and Q-Learning agent will be generated to show which one algorithm is better.
